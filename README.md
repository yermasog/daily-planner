# Daily Planner
A basic app for keeping track of daily to-do tasks

## Description

This simple calendar application allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. Each hour will change color depending on the time of day. This app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I also used [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to work with dates and times.
